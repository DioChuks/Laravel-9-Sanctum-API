## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

## Laravel on Render

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework. Follow these easy steps to deploy your laravel 9^ project to render.

1. Create a new project in the dashboard of render.com: https://dashboard.render.com/projects/new
2. Clone this repo to your local machine (or download it as zip)
3. Run `composer install` from inside the directory you cloned or unzipped into
4. Copy `.env.example` file located at root level of the repository to `.env`.
5. After that, create a new repository and push to it, then connect with render and deploy.
